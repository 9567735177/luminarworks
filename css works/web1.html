        <H1 style="color: yellowgreen;">History of coffee</H1>
    </h2>
    <p>The history of coffee begins in legend. According to one legend, ancestors of today's Oromo people in a
        region of Jimma in Ethiopia were the first to recognize the energizing effect of the coffee plant.[1]
        However, no direct evidence that has been found earlier than the 15th century, or even where coffee was
        first cultivated. The story of Kaldi, the 9th-century Ethiopian goatherd who discovered the stimulating
        effect of coffee when he noticed how excited his goats became after eating the beans from a coffee plant,
        did not appear in writing until 1671 and is probably apocryphal.[1]
        There is evidence of either coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree from the early 16th century, in
        the Sufi monasteries of Yemen,[2] spreading soon to Mecca and Medina. By the 16th century, it had reached
        the rest of the Middle East, South India (Karnataka), Persia, Turkey, India, and northern Africa. Coffee
        then spread to the Balkans, Italy, and to the rest of Europe, as well as Southeast Asia.</p>

        Coffee came to India well before the East India company, through an India Sufi saint named "Baba Budan".[74]
        The first record of coffee growing in India is following the introduction of coffee beans from Yemen by Baba
        Budan to the hills of Chikmagalur, Karnataka in 1670.[75] Since then coffee plantations have become
        established in the region, extending south to Kodagu.[74]

        Coffee production in India is dominated in the hill tracts of South Indian states, with the state of
        Karnataka accounting 53% followed by Kerala 28% and Tamil Nadu 11% of production of 8,200 tonnes. Indian
        coffee is said to be the finest coffee grown in the shade rather than direct sunlight anywhere in the
        world.[76] There are approximately 250,000 coffee growers in India; 98% of them are small growers.[77] As of
        2009, the production of coffee in India was only 4.5% of the total production in the world. Almost 80% of
        the country's coffee production is exported.[78] Of that which is exported, 70% is bound for Germany,
        Russian federation, Spain, Belgium, Slovenia, United States, Japan, Greece, Netherlands and France, and
        Italy accounts for 29% of the exports. Most of the export is shipped through the Suez Canal.[76]

        Coffee is grown in three regions of India with Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu forming the traditional
        coffee growing region of South India, followed by the new areas developed in the non-traditional areas of
        Andhra Pradesh and Orissa in the eastern coast of the country and with a third region comprising the states
        of Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Tripura, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh of Northeastern India,
        popularly known as "Seven Sister States of India".[79]

        Indian coffee, grown mostly in southern India under monsoon rainfall conditions, is also termed as "Indian
        monsooned coffee". Its flavour is defined as: "The best Indian coffee reaches the flavour characteristics of
        Pacific coffees, but at its worst it is simply bland and uninspiring".[80] The two well known species of
        coffee grown are the Arabica and Robusta. The first variety that was introduced in the Baba Budan Giri hill
        ranges of Karnataka in the 17th century[81] was marketed over the years under the brand names of Kent and
        S.795. Coffee is served in a distinctive drip-style "filter coffee" across Southern India.</P>
